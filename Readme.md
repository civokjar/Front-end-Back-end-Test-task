# Create FE APP, BE API, DB
So, this work/programming test is about verifying the check digit in a Swedish personal identity number (personnummer)


• Make a simple page in some UI framework that you are familiar with (MVC, react, Blazor etc.) where you can add a Customer with a name and personal identification number that is saved in some repository (SQL, NoSQL DB or repository of your choice)

• When you save the Customer the control digit of the Swedish personal identity number (personnummer) should be validated. The control should be carried out in a separate service (use some REST, rpc framework of your choice)

• On a separate page you should be able to display and search all the customers
